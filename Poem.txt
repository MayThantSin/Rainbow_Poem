The Rainbow And The Rain, Sunshine

Rainbow, rainbow
In the sky!
Peeping out
As the cloud goes by. 
Red, orange, blue
Pink and Blue.
There is Indigo
And Violet too.

Rainbow is the promise of: 
Sunshine after the rain
Calm after the storm
Joy after the sadness
Peace after the pain
Love after the Loss.

Love the sunshine 
That you bring!
