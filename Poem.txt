The Rainbow And The Rain, Sunshine

Rainbow, rainbow
In the sky!
Peeping out
As the cloud goes by. 
Red, orange, blue
Pink and Blue.
There is Indigo
And Violet too.

Rainbow is the promise of: 
Sunshine after rain
Calm after storm
Joy after sadness
Peace after pain
Love after Loss

Love the sunshine 
That you bring!
